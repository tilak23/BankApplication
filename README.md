# Creating a new Id
normally a file text will be created as soon as the jar / main is compiled. the number automatic starts changing and updates the number which is used. so the next time some one compiles it, the next 6 digit number wil be created.
example:102456 is created and alloted for a  enduser and then the number is stored in genteringId.txt then next time it starts with 102457
# Database
  automatically a folder is created in the  user folder as database, if you want to set a path for the folder to be created  you can set using Database(String path) while using the particular constructor.
