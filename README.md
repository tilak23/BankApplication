# BankApplication
bank application using file (the data will be stored and update in text document)
# Creating a new Id
normally a file text will be created as soon as the jar / main is compiled. the number automatic starts changing and updates the number which is used. so the next time some one compiles it, the next 6 digit number wil be created.
